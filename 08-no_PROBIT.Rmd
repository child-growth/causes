## Comparison of attributable differences estimated with and without the PROBIT trial


Because PROBIT was the only European study, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis as to the effect of removing PROBIT on attributable differences at 24 months (within the exposures measures during the PROBIT trial). Other than for the estimated associations between fatherâ€™s height and child Z-scores at 24 months (which was measured in few other studies), PROBIT is not highly influential.
