## Overview

__Purpose: __

The primary parameter presented in the "Causes and Consequences of Child Growth Failure in Low- and Middle-income Countries" publications is the population intervention effect (PIE), the change in mean population Z-score if a exposure is shifted to the lowest-risk level, which combines the increase of risk associated with an exposure with the prevalence of the exposure in the population. This page of the supporting information presents plots for pooled relative risks (RR) and average treatment effects (ATE) for each level of each exposure. Relative risk are reported for binary CGF outcomes (stunting, wasting, underweight, severe stunting, severe wasting, and severe underweight) and ATEs are reported for continious Z-score outcomes.

__Interpretation: __
__Implications: __


## To do:

- Add ATE plots


### Relative risks between levels of all exposures for prevalence and cumulative incidence of wasting and stunting outcomes

Plots are grouped and titles by exposure, and each panel of grouped plots visualizez the relative risk between levels of the exposure and different age-specific growth failure outcomes.
