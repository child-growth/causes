## Overview

__Purpose: __ These plots show all results estimated in this study. Cohort-specific results were estimated for each combination of risk factor, outcome, and age category, and then pooled with random- and fixed-effects meta-analysis models.
__Interpretation: __ Each plot shows all cohort-specific estimates for each isk factor, outcome,  age category, and exposure level in the same style as Extended Data Figure 1. Cohort-specific estimates are plotted on each row, comparing the risk of an exposure level to the reference level.  Below the solid horizontal line are region-specific pooled measures of association, pooled using random-effects models. Below the dashed line are overall pooled measures of association, comparing pooling using random or fixed effects models. 
__Implications: __ The plots show all cohort-specific estimates underlying the primary plots in the manuscript as well as the pooled random- and fixed-effects estimates.
