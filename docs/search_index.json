"],["RR.html", "Chapter 2 Relative risk plots 2.1 Overview", " Chapter 2 Relative risk plots 2.1 Overview Purpose: The primary parameter presented in the “Causes and Consequences of Child Growth Failure in Low- and Middle-income Countries” publications is the population intervention effect (PIE), the change in mean population Z-score if a exposure is shifted to the lowest-risk level, which combines the increase of risk associated with an exposure with the prevalence of the exposure in the population. This page of the supporting information presents plots for pooled relative risks (RR) and average treatment effects (ATE) for each level of each exposure. Relative risk are reported for binary CGF outcomes (stunting, wasting, underweight, severe stunting, severe wasting, and severe underweight) and ATEs are reported for continious Z-score outcomes. Interpretation: The primary purpose of this page is to present the pooled point estimates and confidence intervals for all of the results summarized in the Extended Data Figure 2 heatmap, and to allow the reader to compare the levels of risk across categorical exposures. The population intervention effects and attributable fraction presented in the primary manuscript show the result when shifting the exposure distribution to the low-risk reference levels, but the results presented here allow for comparing other exposure levels, like food secure versus moderately food insecure. Implications: The strong risk factors identified through the use of Population Attributable Factors (Extended Data Figure 6) were almost always the strongest risk factors when examining average treatment effects and relative risks and . The 2.1.1 Relative risks between levels of all exposures for prevalence and cumulative incidence of wasting and stunting outcomes Plots are grouped and titles by exposure, and each panel of grouped plots visualizez the relative risk between levels of the exposure and different age-specific growth failure outcomes.

Here, we present the difference in linear and ponderal growth velocities between the observed mean velocities and the estimated mean velocities if the exposures were shifted to the low-risk level. We calculated the change in LAZ, WAZ, length in centimeters, and weight in kilograms within 3-month age intervals, including measurements within a two-week window around each age in months to account for variation in the age of each length measurement. Interpretation: Most risk factors were not significantly associated with increased growth. Implications: An important finding relates to the associations between maternal anthropometry, birth anthropometry, and catch-up growth. We found that maternal anthropometry is generally not associated with growth velocity, consistent with the mostly parallel growth trajectories shown in Figure 3, except for associations between maternal height and early growth. Mother’s height was strongly associated with all 4 measures of growth velocity in the first 3 months of life. Taller mothers gave birth to infants who grew faster (PIE: 0.017 [95% CI: 0.028, 0.006] for LAZ velocity. This is also noticeable in Figure 3a, where growth faltering as measured by change in LAZ is lower in the first 3 months for children of taller mothers than for children of shorter mothers. After 3 months, maternal height had non-significant or very small effects on LAZ, WAZ, height, and weight velocities. Mother’s weight was not associated with LAZ or WAZ velocities but was associated with increased length velocity for most age categories after 6 months and weight velocities before 15 months. Higher maternal BMI was associated with a decreased LAZ velocity before 3 months and increased weight velocity before 6 months, but not with other ages or measures of growth velocity. 3.2 Age-stratified population attributable differences in change in length-for-age Z-scores over 3-month age bands. Exposures, rank ordered by pooled population attributable difference on child LAZ velocities, stratified by the age of the child at the time of anthropometry measurements. The population attributable difference is the expected difference in population mean Z-score if all children had the reference level of the exposure rather than the observed distribution. For all plots, reference levels are printed next to the name of the exposure. Estimates are adjusted for all other measured exposures not on the causal pathway. 3.3 Age-stratified population attributable differences in change in weight-for-age Z-scores over 3-month age bands. Exposures, rank ordered by pooled population attributable difference on child WAZ velocities, stratified by the age of the child at the time of anthropometry measurements.

Here, we present estimates pooled using fixed effects. Inferences about estimates from fixed effects models are restricted to only the included studies, while random effects estimates assume included studies are sampled from a distribution of hypothetical studies.[^1] Interpretation: Fixed effect estimates had narrow confidence intervals, and therefore more risk factors had statistically significant PIEs. Implications: The fixed effect estimates are weighted towards results from larger studies, so are more heavily influenced by the large Jivita-3, Probit, and ZVITAMBO trials. But in general, the key exposures identified from the random-effects estimates were also had the strongest associations when pooled using fixed-effect estimates. 4.2 Primary manuscript figures recreated with estimates pooled using fixed effects More estimates are significant when pooling using fixed effects due to the generally smaller confidence intervals.
