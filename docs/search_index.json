We did not adjust for characteristics that were assumed to be intermediate on the causal path between any exposure and the outcome, because while controlling for mediators may help adjust for unmeasured confounders in some conditions, it can also lead to collider bias. As DAG’s were hand-drawn and are complex for the large number of exposures, we show an example DAG here and then list all potential considered for each exposure in a table below. Interpretation: The DAG below shows the set of adjusted-for exposures and unadjusted-for exposures for the estimated association between maternal weight and child growth faltering. Grey variables are on the causal pathway and are not adjusted for, while blue variables were considered potential confounders and adjusted for. Note collinear variables like maternal BMI are shown as on the causal pathway in this DAG, which may not be biologically accurate, but they were not adjusted for so are included with the potential mediators. Implications: Given the exposures measured in each study, we attempted to maximally adjust for confounding without adjusting for mediators on the casual pathway, which would remove part of the effect of the exposure on the outcome. Confounders were not measured in every cohort, so there could be residual confounding in cohort-specific estimates, and actual DAGs will look different across cohort-specific estimates for each study. 3.2 Simplified example DAG: 3.3 DAG used: Association between maternal weight and child growth faltering 3.4 Table of Adjustment Covariates Exposure Potential adjustment covariates # of children &lt;5 in HH Treatment arm , Mother’s age , Father’s age , Mother’s education , Father’s education , HH wealth , HH food security , Mother’s height , Mother’s weight , BMI , Father’s height , Single parent , # of rooms in HH , Birth order , Treats drinking water , Clean cooking fuel usage, Improved floor , Improved sanitation , Safe water source # of people in HH Treatment arm , Mother’s age , Father’s age , Mother’s education , Father’s education , HH wealth , HH food security , Mother’s height , Mother’s weight , BMI , Father’s height , Single parent , # of rooms in HH , Birth order , Treats drinking water , Clean cooking fuel usage, Improved floor , Improved sanitation , Safe water source # of rooms in HH Treatment arm , Child sex , Mother’s age , Father’s age , Mother’s education , Father’s education , HH wealth , HH food security , Mother’s height , Mother’s weight , BMI , Father’s height , Single parent , # of people in HH , # of children &lt;5 in HH , Birth order , Treats drinking water , Clean cooking fuel usage, Improved floor , Improved sanitation , Safe water source Any wasting &lt;6 mo.

Here, we present estimates pooled using fixed effects. Inferences about estimates from fixed effects models are restricted to only the included studies, while random effects estimates assume included studies are sampled from a distribution of hypothetical studies.[^1] Interpretation: Fixed effect estimates had narrow confidence intervals, and therefore more risk factors had statistically significant PIEs. Implications: The fixed effect estimates are weighted towards results from larger studies, so are more heavily influenced by the large Jivita-3, Probit, and ZVITAMBO trials. But in general, the key exposures identified from the random-effects estimates were also had the strongest associations when pooled using fixed-effect estimates. 4.2 Primary manuscript figures recreated with estimates pooled using fixed effects More estimates are significant when pooling using fixed effects due to the generally smaller confidence intervals.

Here, we present the difference in linear and ponderal growth velocities between the observed mean velocities and the estimated mean velocities if the exposures were shifted to the low-risk level. We calculated the change in LAZ, WAZ, length in centimeters, and weight in kilograms within 3-month age intervals, including measurements within a two-week window around each age in months to account for variation in the age of each length measurement. Interpretation: Most risk factors were not significantly associated with increased growth. Implications: An important finding relates to the associations between maternal anthropometry, birth anthropometry, and catch-up growth. We found that maternal anthropometry is generally not associated with growth velocity, consistent with the mostly parallel growth trajectories shown in Figure 3, except for associations between maternal height and early growth. Mother’s height was strongly associated with all 4 measures of growth velocity in the first 3 months of life. Taller mothers gave birth to infants who grew faster (PIE: 0.017 [95% CI: 0.028, 0.006] for LAZ velocity. This is also noticeable in Figure 3a, where growth faltering as measured by change in LAZ is lower in the first 3 months for children of taller mothers than for children of shorter mothers. After 3 months, maternal height had non-significant or very small effects on LAZ, WAZ, height, and weight velocities. Mother’s weight was not associated with LAZ or WAZ velocities but was associated with increased length velocity for most age categories after 6 months and weight velocities before 15 months. Higher maternal BMI was associated with a decreased LAZ velocity before 3 months and increased weight velocity before 6 months, but not with other ages or measures of growth velocity. 7.2 Age-stratified population attributable differences in change in length-for-age Z-scores over 3-month age bands.

This page shows age and regionally stratified plots to allow comparisons of differences across regions in age-specific differences in associations between exposures and child growth faltering. Interpretation: There are regional variations in the rank-ordering of exposures by age and the magnitude of associations, but no unexpected findings obscured by pooling age-specific estimates over regions. Variations in estimates arise from different study populations, different numbers of studies measuring exposures in each region and at each age, and heterogeneity in the study-specific estimates underlying the random-effects pooled estimates. Implications: We did not identify important regionally-specific patterns in age-specific exposure-growth faltering associations that were missed by using regionally-pooled estimates in the supplemental figures. 9.2 Region and age-stratified population attributable differences in length-for-age Z-scores South Asia Africa Latin America 9.3 Region and age-stratified population attributable differences in weight-for-length Z-scores South Asia Africa Latin America 9.4 Region and age-stratified population attributable differences in weight-for-age Z-scores South Asia Africa Latin America 9.5 Associations between key exposures and wasting and stunting cumulative incidence, stratified by the age of the child and by region South Asia Africa Latin America 9.6 Associations between key exposures and growth failure of different severities, stratified by region South Asia Africa Latin America 9.7 Adjusted differences in linear growth velocity (in centimeters) across 3-month age 624 bands, by quartile of weight-for-length z-score (WLZ) in the preceding three months, stratified by region.

This page of the supporting information presents plots for pooled relative risks (RR) and average treatment effects (ATE) for each level of each exposure. Relative risk are reported for binary CGF outcomes (stunting, wasting, underweight, severe stunting, severe wasting, and severe underweight) and ATEs are reported for continuous Z-score outcomes. Interpretation: The primary purpose of this page is to present the pooled point estimates and confidence intervals for all of the results summarized in the Extended Data Figure 2 heatmap, and to allow the reader to compare the levels of risk across categorical exposures. The population intervention effects and attributable fraction presented in the primary manuscript show the result when shifting the exposure distribution to the low-risk reference levels, but the results presented here allow for comparing other exposure levels, like food secure versus moderately food insecure. Implications: The strong risk factors identified through the use of Population Attributable Factors (Extended Data Figure 6) were almost always the strongest risk factors when examining average treatment effects and relative risks across different age categories and outcomes. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD:08-relative-risk.Rmd - Add ATE plots - Debug plots ======= &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 46a38e4142817e1f52434dd63b29c36ab486c289:01-relative-risk.Rmd 10.1.1 Relative risks between levels of all exposures for prevalence and cumulative incidence of wasting and stunting outcomes Plots are grouped and titles by exposure, and each panel of grouped plots visualizez the relative risk between levels of the exposure and different age-specific growth failure outcomes.

It was also one of the largest studies, so may have an influential effect on the pooled estimates. Because of differences in income, environmental conditions, and population anthropometry, we reconducted the primary analyses without the PROBIT trial and present the results here. Interpretation: Exclusion of the PROBIT trail did not affect the main inferences presented in the manuscript. Implications: It was appropriate to include the PROBIT trial in the pooled results presented as the primary results of the manuscript. 12.2 Comparison of attributable differences estimated with and without the PROBIT trial Because PROBIT was the only European study, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis as to the effect of removing PROBIT on attributable differences at 24 months (within the exposures measures during the PROBIT trial). Other than for the estimated associations between father’s height and child Z-scores at 24 months (which was measured in few other studies), PROBIT is not highly influential.

The figure shows population intervention effects on child WAZ at age 24 months. Exposures were rank ordered, and each exposure label includes the reference level used to estimate population intervention effects, shifting exposures for all children from their observed exposure to the reference level. Cohort-specific estimates were adjusted for all measured confounders using ensemble machine learning and TMLE, and then pooled using random effects (Methods). Columns for each exposure summarize the number of children that contributed to each analysis and the percentage of children for whom exposure was shifted to the reference level, and the estimated population intervention effect (PIE) and 95% confidence interval. Interpretation: Because weight is a function of both skeletal weight (primarily from length) and body muscle and fat, WAZ is a combination of LAZ and WLZ. We expect to see similiarly important exposures as for LAZ and WAZ. Implications: The strength of associations between exposures and WAZ at 24 months is roughly an average of the strengths of associations between exposures and LAZ and WLZ shown in figure 2. There were no unexpected associations when using WAZ as an outcome. 14.0.1 Figure "]]
