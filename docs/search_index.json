Exposures, rank ordered by pooled population attributable difference on child length velocities, stratified by the age of the child at the time of anthropometry measurements. The population attributable difference is the expected difference in population mean differences in lengths (cm) if all children had the reference level of the exposure rather than the observed distribution.

Inferences about estimates from fixed effects models are restricted to only the included studies.[^1] The random effects approach was more conservative in the presence of study heterogeneity, as evidenced by larger confidence intervals around each point estimates. Overall, the inference from results produced by each method was similar. 4.2 Primary manuscript figures recreated with estimates pooled using fixed effects More estimates are significant when pooling using fixed effects due to the generally smaller confidence intervals.

Red and orange cells are harmful exposures, while blue and green cells are protective exposures. The outcomes are labeled at the top of the columns, with each set of three columns the set of three ages analyzed for that outcome. Each row is a level of an exposure variable, with reference levels excluded. Rows are sorted top to bottom by increasing average p-value. Grey cells denote comparisons that were not estimated or could not be estimated because of data sparsity in the exposure-outcome combination.
