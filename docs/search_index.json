Inferences about estimates from fixed effects models are restricted to only the included studies.[^1] The random effects approach was more conservative in the presence of study heterogeneity, as evidenced by larger confidence intervals around each point estimates. Overall, the inference from results produced by each method was similar. 4.1 Primary manuscript figures recreated with estimates pooled using fixed effects More estimates are significant when pooling using fixed effects due to the generally smaller confidence intervals.

Red and orange cells are harmful exposures, while blue and green cells are protective exposures. The outcomes are labeled at the top of the columns, with each set of three columns the set of three ages analyzed for that outcome. Each row is a level of an exposure variable, with reference levels excluded. Rows are sorted top to bottom by increasing average p-value. Grey cells denote comparisons that were not estimated or could not be estimated because of data sparsity in the exposure-outcome combination. The first plot included region-stratified estimates, the second shows significance of estimates pooled across cohorts using fixed effects models, and the third shows significance of unadjusted estimates. 8.1 Heatmap of significance of estimates, region stratified 8.2 Heatmap of significance of estimates pooled using fixed effects 8.3 Heatmap of significance of estimate, unadjusted "],

Other than for the estimated associations between fatherâ€™s height and child Z-scores at 24 months (which was measured in few other studies), PROBIT is not highly influential. "],
